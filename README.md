Overview of App: Decentralized Professional Networking Application

The application being developed is a **decentralized professional networking application** with the use of **blockchain technology** while applying **zero-knowledge proofs** in providing security for users in terms of credential management and verification. It is highly privacy-first; it helps the professionals validate their identities, gain VCs, and show their credentials without giving away sensitive information.

Empower professionals, verifiers, and organizations to interact directly without intermediaries. The use of **Privado ID** and **PolygonID** would enable identity management, issuance, and verification of verifiable credentials.

### Key Functionalities:

#### 1. **Login with Document Verification**
The app shall utilize **Privado ID**; thus, it shall provide for a secure, private authentication process. The user's identity would be verified through document verification. This shall be achieved in the following manner:
**Document Verification**: This is where a user verifies an identity at the point of their enrolment by uploading official documents onto **Privado ID's SDK**, such as government-issued IDs. These documents then get verified in a secure manner and turned into **a decentralized identity.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: After verification, a **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is allocated to them, which becomes their unique identity on the app. Unlike in standard sign-up logins, this does not need any storage of personal information on any centralized servers. Instead, the DID is handled over the blockchain while users keep control through a secure wallet.

#### 2. **Professional Profile Creation**
After verifying themselves, users will be granted permission to make a professional profile by providing the following information:
• Name and Job Title.
• Enlisted Skills and Work Experience.
• Blockchain-verified Credentials such as educational degrees or past employment.

Because it is on-chain, any party cannot alter the data in a profile. The data is solely owned by the user and may be shared with whoever they choose.

#### 3. **Issuing Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**
It integrates **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**, which are pieces of information regarding the user that were created and cryptographically signed in such a way that everyone can be certain about their legitimacy. Here is how it works:
**Schema Creation**: Credential schemas are created for specific use cases where the credentials can be utilized to validate if a user has a particular status, say frequent travel, certification, or job position.
**Creation of VC's** - There is an organization called Issuer, which issues VCs to the user. For example, a university would provide a **degree** as verifiable credential, and an employer might give a credential validating a job role.
**Privado ID and Schema**: Using the **Privado ID**, the issuer defines a schema on which credentials are issued based on set criteria. Issued credentials are stored in the user's **Privado wallet** in a tamper-proof manner.

#### 4. **Verifying Credentials with Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
The app integrates the **zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)** functionality to help users prove their credentials without necessarily disclosing the actual data for such proof. Here is how verification goes:
VERIFICATION REQUEST: Sometimes there could be a scenario where any third party - normally the recruiter or service provider - wants verification about the particular credential that the user may possess. Here, the user should be able to generate a **ZKP**, proving that his/her attribute credentials meet the requirement criteria having a degree or being a frequent traveler.
 SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE: In this case, the user discloses only the required proof - "Yes, I have this credential" - without giving out any other personal information.
• Verifier Verification: The verifier verifies the proof using the **Privado ID Query Builder** or **PolygonID Verifier**. Since verification is done via cryptographic proofs, this will be a trusted party without sensitive data disclosure.

#### 5. **Application for Jobs Using Credentials**
The application makes job applications easier since clients are able to send directly their **verified credentials**:
- **Direct Applications**: Users apply to job postings, and instead of uploading regular resumes, they provide their **blockchain-verified credentials**. Any claim made - such as degrees, certifications, or endorsements - is guaranteed to be true with no potential for untruths.
- **Private Job Matching**: Companies can match users to their job postings based on verified credentials without necessarily seeing a full profile. This way, **privacy-focused recruiting** becomes an option.

#### 6. **Endorsements and Recommendations**
Users can obtain recommendations from colleagues or supervisors. These recommendations are issued as **non-fungible tokens or verifiable credentials:** *
NFT Endorsements: Colleagues can endorse the skills of users, which are signed cryptographically and stored on the blockchain, tamper-proof.
Reputation System: A reputation system makes sure that endorsers build up more and more credibility over time by adding more trust to the endorsements that users get.

#### 7. **Decentralized and Secure Storage**
All data, including credentials and endorsements and profile information, is held in the blockchain; thus, it is:
- **Tamper-Proof**: Data, once added, cannot be changed or deleted.
- **User-Controlled**: Users have ownership of their data, and they control who can access it. This can be selectively disclosed during job applications or verification.

#### 8. **Identity Management Using Wallet**
The app uses a **blockchain wallet** for safe identity management:
- **VC Storage**: A user stores all his credentials in the wallet.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: The wallet will also provide users with the facility to generate **ZKPs** for verification requests.
- **Push Notifications**: Using the wallet, notifications will inform users regarding the issuance of new credentials and verification requests against their identity.

### Use Cases:
#### 1. **Frequent Traveler Credential**
One can be issued a **Frequent Traveler Credential** by a travel agency or a government entity. As such, this credential will prove his status as a frequent traveler, and hotels or airlines can verify this without necessarily divulging the entire record of his travel history.

#### 2. **Verified Credentials Job Applicant**
A job seeker applies for a position, and the company can auto-check on the applicant's education and work experience with their blockchain-verified credentials. This eliminates traditional checks with references altogether and accelerates the selection process.

#### 3. **Endorsement for Skills**
An attested endorsement of coding capabilities by the manager is given to the user in a tech company. They are issued as NFTs on the blockchain and get stored as proof for later use in job applications.

### Security and Privacy:

* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Users will be able to demonstrate their identity and credentials without leaking sensitive information; this provides both security and privacy.
- **Blockchain-Backed Trust**: All credentials need to pass the cycle of verification and signing by trusted issuers, coming out of such processes immutable and tamper-proof.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: A person handles everything that concerns decentralized identity with the help of blockchain and possesses full ownership of their data.
- **Privado ID and PolygonID**: The set of technologies ensures that the application meets the highest standards in the field of identity verification and management of credentials with no friction and cryptographic integrity.
